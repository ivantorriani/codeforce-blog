### Original Code

```
def abbrev(word):
      remove = [-1,0]
      output = []
      word_list = list(word)

      if (len(word_list) <= 10):
            return word
            
      else:
            last_word = word_list[remove[0]]
            first_word = word_list[remove[1]]

            return str(first_word) + str((len(word_list) - 2)) + str(last_word)
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
      n = int(input())
      for _ in range(n):
            word = input()
            print(abbrev(word))
```



### What I Learned

The biggest thing I learned was the use of `for _ in range(n)` when codeforce asks for and output with multiple lines. Set the range to `n` when we have `n = int(input())` in the for loop,  then add logic for the code inside. 

Even though it wasn't really necessary, I refreshed myself on the fact that `list(string)` makes a string into a list with individual letters like `[f,a,c,e]`. 

### What I Can Improve

I submitted this pretty half-hazardly but if I went through it again, there is a lot of things I could clean up. Firstly, I didn't need `remove` and `outputs`. I also didn't really need to make it a function. The word as a string can already be indexed, it didn't need to be made a list with `list(string)`.
